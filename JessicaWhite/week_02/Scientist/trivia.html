  <p>1. Shannon's hero was Thomas Edison; who as he found out later in life was actually a distant cousin, connected through John Ogden, an early settler in New Jersey, according to his Massachusetts Institute of Technology obituary.</p>

  <p>2. His pre-war work dealt with switches and relays. Shannon's master's thesis of 1937 discussed the application of Boolean logic to switches with the intention of simplifying telephone switchboards. As his ideas developed, however, he realized that the binary function of switches could be used as the basis for a standardized logic circuit and functional digital computers.</p>

  <p>3. Before Shannon moved back to MIT in 1956, he became known for a rather peculiar sort of talent: juggling while riding a unicycle around Bell Labs.</p>

  <p>4. In the 1970's, Shannon built the world's first juggling robot, using an Erector Set (the equivalent of a Mecanno set). The robot, which was built to look like the Vaudevillian and film comedian WC Fields, was able to juggle three balls at one time - but bounced and caught them, rather than throwing them in the air and catching them.</p>

  <p>5. Shannon was fascinated by game theory, and used to visit Las Vegas with his wife, Betty, and fellow MIT mathematician Ed Thorpe. There they used to play Blackjack, using their mathematical theories to count and predict card sequences. The two men also invented a small computer that could be concealed about one's person, to aid them in playing Roulette. This is considered one of the earliest wearable computers.</p>

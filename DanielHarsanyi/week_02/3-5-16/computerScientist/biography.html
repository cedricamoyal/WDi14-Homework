    <p> Living from April 1916 to February 2001 I was a mathematician, electrical engineer, cryptographer and known as "the father of information theory". Born to a self-made business man and teacher I gre up in Gaylord, Michigan and was interested in mechanics and electrics, science and mathematics. At a very young age I was building model planes, boats and a wirless telegraph system to a friend's house - neat huh? It's perhaps fitting that my distant cousin was Thomas Edison!</p>

    <p> After graduating from MIT with 2 bachelors degrees, 1 in electrical engineering and 1 in mathematics, I began expanding on the work of George Boole (the true || false guy - smart gent). I proved that my switching circuits could be used to simplify relays used in telephone call routing switches. I then expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. The logic that I implemented for my electrical switches is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. My work became the foundation of digital circuit design, and so enables that fancy Mac you're reading this on. You're welcome.</p>

    <p>During WWII I worked alongside Alan Turing (can't believe he became the famous one...) working with him on cryptography, trying to decyper the Kaiser's messages. After the war I wrote "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", a work which focused on the problem of how best to encode the information a sender wants to transmit. I have several hobbies including juggling, unicycling, and chess, most of which I like to try and hack - ha!</p>

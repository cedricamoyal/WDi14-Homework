// Create a function called notBad that takes a single argument, a string.
//
// It should find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'bad'.
// If the 'bad' follows the 'not', then it should replace the whole
//'not'...'bad' substring with 'good' and return the result.
// If it doesn't find 'not' and 'bad' in the right sequence (or at all),
//just return the original sentence.
// For example:
//
//   notBad('This dinner is not that bad!'): 'This dinner is good!'
//   notBad('This movie is not so bad!'): 'This movie is good!'
//   notBad('This dinner is bad!'): 'This dinner is bad!'


//PC
// I need to create a function called not bad that takes a string arguemnt.
//Within the sentence once the words not and bad respectively are located their
//subsrting will be replaced with good.
// If the phrase is not located the console.log will return the original string phase.
//not .....bad = good


//NOT COMPLETE
var notBad = function ("string"){
  str.substring(not[, bad])
if ("string" ===  str.substring){
  console.log ( "good")

}

console.log("")

notBad ( "This dinner is not that bad")

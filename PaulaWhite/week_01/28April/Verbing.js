// Create a function called verbing. It should take a single argument, a string.
//If its length is at least 3, it should add 'ing' to its end,
//unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case it should add 'ly' instead.
//If the string length is less than 3, it should leave it unchanged. For example:
//
//   verbing('swim'): 'swimming'
//   verbing('swimming'): 'swimmingly'
//   verbing('go'): 'go'

//PC
// Create a verbing function that is a string.
// if the string is 3 characters or greater it should console.log ("ing")
//to the end of the word.
//if however it already ends in "ing" the last 3 characters of that string need
//to be subtracted off the word length and replaced with "ly"
//If the string.length is < 3 characters the console/log = original word


// Verbing (NOT COMPLETE)
var verbing = function ("string"){

  if (string.length >= 3)
  console.log (string + " ing ")

  if (string.length <= 3 && string.length(-1, -2, -3) === ing)
  console.log (string + " ly ")

  else
  console.log(string;)
return verbing;

}
verbing = (hello);
